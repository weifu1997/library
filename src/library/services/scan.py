"""Vault scan + sync service.

Walks the mirror vault on disk, sha256-hashes each file, joins with
the live `files` rows in db, and categorises every (file_entry, disk
file) pair as one of:

  - in_sync    Disk and db agree on path + hash. Most common.
  - new        File on disk not referenced by any live entry.
  - missing    Live entry references a path with nothing on disk.
  - moved      Hash matches an entry but the path differs (rename or
               relocate; the difference between the two is which field
               changed and is implicit from the path comparison).

Only scans live (deleted_at IS NULL) entries. Soft-deleted entries
are not considered missing — if their disk file is gone, that's fine
(the user soft-deleted; cleanup happens at purge time).

This is read-only. It NEVER writes to db; the apply step is a separate
service used by /sync, /ingest --all, /forget --all-missing.
