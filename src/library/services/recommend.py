"""Recommendation / discovery service.

Goal: cut agent loop count.

When the agent has identified one relevant entry, the discovery layer
hands it the most likely neighbours immediately — no extra search /
read_files / re-rank loops. Two access patterns:

  - find_related(entry_id, top_k):  given a known-relevant seed entry,
                                    return entries most likely related
  - find_related_to_query(...):     reserved for future query-time use

Algorithm: random walk with restart over the entry_relations graph.

  edges = entry_relations rows (any source_kind)
  weight(a, b) = observation_count
  start at seed, K independent walks of bounded length. At each step:
    - with prob alpha (0.15) restart at seed
    - else jump to a random neighbour weighted by edge weight
  return entries by visit frequency (excluding the seed itself).

Why random walk over a single SQL "neighbours by weight" query:
  - propagates structural distance: a 2-hop neighbour through 3
    different paths gets credit
  - naturally combines signals (cooccurrence + tag_overlap +
    citation_graph) without picking one — they all become edges
  - tunable: alpha controls "stay close to seed" vs "wander far"
  - cheap: O(walks * length) lookups, all in-memory after one db pull

Limits:
  - graph cached per call (rebuild on each invocation; small enough)
  - top-k returned with scores (visit count / total walk steps)
  - if seed has no edges → empty result, not an error
