"""Pipeline contract (DESIGN.md §11.2).

Pipelines are pure: they read bytes via storage, call the LLM, and
return a `PipelineResult`. They never touch the DB — the handler does
that, so the write-once rules and transaction are enforced in one
place.

A pipeline also knows how to **read back** a previously-ingested file:
`read_segment(file, locator, storage)` answers questions of the form
"give me section s3 of this file" or "give me lines 100-150". The
agent's `read_files` tool is a thin dispatcher — for each entry, it
resolves the appropriate pipeline by mime/ext and delegates.

Containers (zip / tar / mbox / git_repo) override `list_members` to
return their manifest. The same `read_segment` then accepts a
`member_path` locator and dispatches internally to a sub-pipeline for
that member's mime type. Non-container pipelines return None from
`list_members`.
