"""Pipeline framework: contract + registry + first concrete (text).

Per DESIGN.md §11.2 each pipeline produces, from one LLM call:
  - files.summary   (write-once, content-only)
  - files.description  (write-once, structured JSON)
  - files.kind      (write-once, content-only)
  - files.extra     (write-once, content-only)
  - the entry's catalog_id (best-guess placement; restructure may move later)
  - the entry's entry_tags (chosen against current vocabulary, may create new)
  - the entry's extra (position-aware insight)

The pipeline does NOT touch the DB. It returns a `PipelineResult`; the
ingest_file handler is responsible for persistence (write-once locking,
audit events, tag resolution, transaction).
