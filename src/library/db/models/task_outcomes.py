"""task_outcomes — DESIGN.md §8.4.

Scheduling-side fact table. Records "what did task X do to object Y when?"
so handlers can answer idempotence / recency questions WITHOUT reading
audit_events. Read by infrastructure only; INSERT-only; pruned on a 30-day
rolling window by `prune` (task_outcomes target).

Why a separate table instead of audit_events:
  - audit_events is the "data-change event stream" — read by humans for
    auditing. Mixing scheduling state (entry_enriched, reflect_turn_completed,
    etc.) into it pollutes the human-readable audit and forces JSON-path
    queries the index can't serve.
  - task_outcomes has dedicated indexes on (task_kind, object_kind, object_id)
    and (task_kind, completed_at) — exactly the access patterns scheduling
    needs.
