"""mine_relations - unified cheap-signal miner dispatcher.

Three non-LLM miners share a daily slot. They write raw observations into
entry_relations rows that explicit `/discover --vet` requests or optional
batch vet_relations later judge:

  miner                      legacy interval
  ------------------------------------------
  session_cooccurrence       daily
  tag_overlap                daily
  citation_graph             daily

Why merged: dispatcher bookkeeping was more complex without buying anything
(the three miners do not constrain each other, but they are always
co-scheduled). One kind, one interval, three phases.

Payload (all optional):
  {"miners": ["session_cooccurrence", "tag_overlap",
              "citation_graph"]}  # default: all
