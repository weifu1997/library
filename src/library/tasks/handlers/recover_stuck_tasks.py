"""recover_stuck_tasks — DESIGN.md §9.1.

Self-healing: when a worker dies mid-task (process crash, OOM, lease expired
without heartbeat reaching DB), the row stays at status='running' forever
unless something resurrects it. This handler does that.

Strategy: any row at status='running' AND lease_expires_at < now (with a tiny
grace window) is assumed dead. We:
  - reset status='pending', clear locked_by + lease_expires_at
  - leave attempts unchanged (the runner already incremented on claim — it's
    "fair" to count this as one used attempt; backoff is not extended since
    we don't know how the worker died)
  - if attempts >= max_attempts, mark dead instead

Audit: one `task_recovered` event per recovered row, plus one `task_marked_dead`
per row that exhausted retries.
