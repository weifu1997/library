    `put` accepts an optional (display_name, folder_path) hint pair.
    Local + S3 ignore them — they keep using the explicit `key`.
    Mirror uses them to build the on-disk path; `key` is then ignored
    on input and the FINAL relative path is returned.

    Returns the final storage_key the caller should persist to db.
    Local + S3 always return `key` unchanged. Mirror may return a
    different value (after sanitize / collision-resolution).
