"""Mirror storage backend — folder-tree on disk that matches user intent.

Storage layout under LIBRARY_HOME/library/:

    research/llm/paper.pdf
    notes/2026-05/meeting.md
    photos/IMG_001.jpg
    bundle.tar.gz

Storage_key in the db is the relative posix path (e.g.
'research/llm/paper.pdf'). Sanitization happens at put-time and
collisions are resolved with ' (1)', ' (2)' suffixes — the same
numbering convention as services.upload._resolve_display_name so
disk basename and DB display_name stay identical.

This backend is the new default for local installs because:
  - users can browse / open / rsync / git the vault directly
  - no UUID indirection means the vault survives library removal
  - ingest stays uniform: pipelines call storage.get(key) and don't
    care which backend is in play

Trade-offs vs local UUID-flat:
  - dedup is OFF (handled at the upload service layer based on
    backend type) — same bytes uploaded twice = two files
  - rename / move costs an extra disk op (transactional with db)
  - unicode / cross-platform filename quirks need sanitize()
