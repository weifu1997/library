# Cross-Layer Thinking Guide

> **Purpose**: Think through data flow across layers before implementing.

---

## The Problem

**Most bugs happen at layer boundaries**, not within layers.

Common cross-layer bugs:

- API returns format A, frontend expects format B
- Database stores X, service transforms to Y, but loses data
- Multiple layers implement the same logic differently

---

## Before Implementing Cross-Layer Features

### Step 1: Map the Data Flow

Draw out how data moves:

```
Source → Transform → Store → Retrieve → Transform → Display
```

For each arrow, ask:

- What format is the data in?
- What could go wrong?
- Who is responsible for validation?

### Step 2: Identify Boundaries

| Boundary              | Common Issues                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| API ↔ Service         | Type mismatches, missing fields   |
| Service ↔ Database    | Format conversions, null handling |
| Backend ↔ Frontend    | Serialization, date formats       |
| Component ↔ Component | Props shape changes               |

### Step 3: Define Contracts

For each boundary:

- What is the exact input format?
- What is the exact output format?
- What errors can occur?

---

## Common Cross-Layer Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Implicit Format Assumptions

**Bad**: Assuming date format without checking

**Good**: Explicit format conversion at boundaries

### Mistake 2: Scattered Validation

**Bad**: Validating the same thing in multiple layers

**Good**: Validate once at the entry point

### Mistake 3: Leaky Abstractions

**Bad**: Component knows about database schema

**Good**: Each layer only knows its neighbors

### Mistake 4: Every Consumer Parses The Same Payload

**Bad**: A command reads JSONL events and casts fields inline:

```typescript
const thread = (ev as { thread?: string }).thread;
const labels = (ev as { labels?: string[] }).labels;
```

This looks local, but it means every consumer owns a private version of the
event contract. The next field change will update one command and miss another.

**Good**: Decode once at the event boundary, then export typed projections:

```typescript
if (!isThreadEvent(ev)) return false;
return ev.thread === filter.thread;
```

**Rule**: For append-only logs, JSON streams, RPC payloads, or config files,
create one owner for:

- event / payload type definitions
- type guards and normalization from `unknown`
- metadata projections used by UI commands
- reducers that replay state from the source of truth

Rendering code may format fields, but it must not redefine the payload contract.

---

## Checklist for Cross-Layer Features

Before implementation:

- [ ] Mapped the complete data flow
- [ ] Identified all layer boundaries
- [ ] Defined format at each boundary
- [ ] Decided where validation happens

After implementation:

- [ ] Tested with edge cases (null, empty, invalid)
- [ ] Verified error handling at each boundary
- [ ] Checked data survives round-trip
- [ ] Checked that consumers import shared decoders / projections instead of
      casting payload fields locally
- [ ] Checked that derived state points back to the source event identifier
      (`seq`, `id`, `version`) instead of inventing a second cursor

---

## Cross-Platform Template Consistency

In Trellis, command templates (e.g., `record-session.md`) exist in **multiple platforms** with identical or near-identical content. This is a cross-layer boundary.

### Checklist: After Modifying Any Command Template

- [ ] Find all platforms with the same command: `find src/templates/*/commands/trellis/ -name "<command>.*"`
- [ ] Update all platform copies (Markdown `.md` and TOML `.toml`)
- [ ] For Gemini TOML: adapt line continuations (`\\` vs `\`) and triple-quoted strings
- [ ] Run `/trellis:check-cross-layer` to verify nothing was missed

**Real-world example**: Updated `record-session.md` in Claude to use `--mode record`, but forgot iFlow, Kilo, OpenCode, and Gemini — caught by cross-layer check.

---

## Generated Runtime Template Upgrade Consistency

Some generated files are both documentation and runtime input. In Trellis,
`.trellis/workflow.md` is parsed by `get_context.py`, `workflow_phase.py`,
SessionStart filters, and per-turn hooks. Template changes must be validated
against both fresh init and upgrade paths.

### Checklist: After Modifying A Runtime-Parsed Template

- [ ] Identify every runtime parser that reads the template, not just the file
      writer that installs it
- [ ] Check whether relevant syntax lives outside obvious managed regions
      such as tag blocks
- [ ] Verify fresh `init` output and a versioned `update` scenario that writes
      the older `.trellis/.version`
- [ ] Add an upgrade regression using an older pristine template fixture, then
      assert the installed file reaches the current packaged shape
- [ ] Update the backend spec that owns the runtime contract

---

## Versioned Documentation Boundary

Versioned documentation is a cross-layer boundary: source paths, `docs.json`
version routing, and the rendered version selector must all describe the same
release line.

### Checklist: Before Editing Versioned Docs

- [ ] Identify the target release line: stable, beta, or RC
- [ ] Verify the edited MDX path matches that line:
  - stable: `docs-site/{start,advanced,...}` and `docs-site/zh/{start,advanced,...}`
  - beta: `docs-site/beta/**` and `docs-site/zh/beta/**`
  - RC: `docs-site/rc/**` and `docs-site/zh/rc/**`
- [ ] Verify `docs.json` navigation points the version label to the same paths
- [ ] Grep the opposite tree for release-line-specific terms before committing
- [ ] Treat beta content appearing under root release paths as a source-path bug,
      not a rendering bug

**Real-world example**: A beta-only task workflow change documented
`prd.md` + `design.md` + `implement.md`, task-creation consent, and Codex
mode banners under root `start/` and `advanced/` paths. The docs site then
served 0.6 beta behavior under the Release selector. The fix was to restore root
release docs, move the 0.6 content to `beta/` and `zh/beta/`, and add a grep
audit for beta markers against the root release tree.

**Real-world example**: Codex inline mode changed workflow platform markers from
`[Codex]` / `[Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]` to `[codex-sub-agent]` /
`[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]`. Fresh init was correct, but
`trellis update` only merged `[workflow-state:*]` blocks and preserved stale
markers outside those blocks. Result: upgraded projects got new hook scripts
but old workflow routing, so `get_context.py --mode phase --platform codex`
could return empty Phase 2.1 detail.

## Mode-Detection Probe Checklist

When a CLI auto-detects a mode by probing a remote resource (e.g., checking if `index.json` exists to decide marketplace vs direct download):

### Before implementing:

- [ ] Probe runs in **ALL** code paths that use the result (interactive, `-y`, `--flag` combos)
- [ ] 404 vs transient error are distinguished — don't treat both as "not found"
- [ ] Transient errors **abort or retry**, never silently switch modes
- [ ] Shared state (caches, prefetched data) is **reset** when context changes (e.g., user switches source)
- [ ] **Shortcut paths** (e.g., `--template` skipping picker) must have the same error-handling quality as the probed path — check that downstream functions don't call catch-all wrappers

### After implementing:

- [ ] Trace every path from probe result to the mode-decision branch — no fallthrough
- [ ] External format contracts (giget URI, raw URLs) are tested or at least documented as comments
- [ ] Metadata reads consume a complete response or use a streaming parser — never parse a fixed-size prefix as full JSON
- [ ] When reconstructing a composite identifier from parsed parts, verify **all** fields are included and in the **correct position** (e.g., `provider:repo/path#ref` not `provider:repo#ref/path`)
- [ ] Verify that **action functions** called after a shortcut don't internally use the old catch-all fetch — they must use the probe-quality variant when error distinction matters

**Real-world example**: Custom registry flow had 8 bugs across 3 review rounds: (1) probe only ran in interactive mode, (2) transient errors fell through to wrong mode, (3) giget URI had `#ref` in wrong position, (4) prefetched templates leaked across source switches, (5) `--template` shortcut bypassed probe but `downloadTemplateById` internally used catch-all `fetchTemplateIndex`, turning timeouts into "Template not found".

**Real-world example**: Agent-session update hints fetched npm `latest` metadata with `response.read(4096)` and then parsed it as complete JSON. The `@mindfoldhq/trellis` package metadata exceeded 4 KB, so the JSON was truncated, parse failed silently, and the first session injection showed no update hint. Fix: read the complete response before parsing, and add a regression where `version` is followed by an 8 KB metadata tail.

## Cross-Platform Template Consistency

In Trellis, command templates (e.g., `record-session.md`) exist in **multiple platforms** with identical or near-identical content. This is a cross-layer boundary.

### Checklist: After Modifying Any Command Template

- [ ] Find all platforms with the same command: `find src/templates/*/commands/trellis/ -name "<command>.*"`
- [ ] Update all platform copies (Markdown `.md` and TOML `.toml`)
- [ ] For Gemini TOML: adapt line continuations (`\\` vs `\`) and triple-quoted strings
- [ ] Run `/trellis:check-cross-layer` to verify nothing was missed

**Real-world example**: Updated `record-session.md` in Claude to use `--mode record`, but forgot iFlow, Kilo, OpenCode, and Gemini — caught by cross-layer check.

## GUI-Writable Settings / Config Overlay Boundary

Turning a `.env`-only setting into something the Settings page can toggle
spans 4 layers (overlay → API → frontend type → i18n). The worker
`worker_enabled` toggle is the reference implementation.

### Checklist: When Making A Setting GUI-Writable

- [ ] Add the key to `src/library/services/config_overlay.py::_ALLOWED_FIELDS`
      AND the bool-coercion tuple (if boolean) — the overlay is a whitelist;
      missing it means the GUI write is silently rejected
- [ ] In `GET /settings/server`, report **configured intent** and **live
      runtime state** as separate fields (`worker_enabled` vs `worker_running`)
      so the UI can tell "configured on but not actually running" apart
- [ ] In the PUT handler, apply the runtime side effect (e.g.
      `worker_lifecycle.start()/stop()`) in try/except; on failure write a
      sidecar `worker_error` field but keep the settings write itself intact —
      a start/stop failure must never corrupt the persisted value
- [ ] Frontend: add the field to `ServerSettings` (optional for live state),
      the `ServerBooleanField` union, and the `setServerBoolean` special case;
      refetch `settings.server()` after the PUT so live state re-renders
- [ ] i18n strings for both `en` and `zh`
- [ ] A `None` patch means **"clear this override"** — derive the live
      side-effect from the *effective* post-merge value, never from
      `bool(patch_value)`. `bool(None) == False`, so `PUT {worker_enabled:
      null}` would wrongly STOP a running worker whose effective setting after
      clearing reverts to `true`. Re-read via `get_settings()` after
      `cache_clear()` (see `routes_settings.py::update_llm_settings`)
- [ ] Persistence across restart is inherited from the overlay file — test it
      (PUT off → restart → still off), don't assume it
- [ ] When the toggle controls a live process (worker on/off), surface the
      backlog that stopping it strands: the Settings page reuses
      `/v1/tasks/running-count` (the StatusBar poller) to warn "N pending
      tasks won't be processed" whenever `worker_running === false`

### Real-world example

The worker stayed "waiting forever" because `WORKER_ENABLED=false` in `.env`
meant `library serve` never started the in-process runner, and nothing surfaced
that queued tasks were stuck. Fix = lifecycle singleton (`worker_lifecycle`),
overlay-writable `worker_enabled`, live `worker_running` in the server GET, a
startup guard warning when disabled with pending tasks, and a scaffold default
flip. The web toggle only controls the in-process runner; split deployments run
`library-worker` externally and are unaffected.

## Reasoning-Model-as-Ingest-Model → "Empty Summary" Gotcha

Which model backs the ingest (or default) profile is a cross-layer decision:
config → LLM adapter (thinking control, `max_tokens`) → pipeline
(`parse_index_response`). A reasoning model silently breaks ingest.

### The failure chain

1. Config points ingest at a reasoning/thinking model (`llm_default_model` /
   `llm_ingest_model` = e.g. `stepfun-ai/step-3.7-flash` on a generic
   openai-compatible proxy).
2. The app injects `extra_body={"thinking": {"type": "disabled"}}` for the
   ingest profile — but a generic openai-compatible proxy may **silently
   ignore** it (only OpenAI proper and a few known dialects honor it).
3. The reasoning model writes chain-of-thought to a separate
   `reasoning_content` field and leaves `content` empty until it finishes
   reasoning.
4. Ingest caps `max_tokens` by input length (`ingest_output_tokens`, ~2000 for
   a typical document). The model burns the whole budget on reasoning →
   `finish_reason='length'`, `content=None`.
5. `parse_index_response` → `parse_tagged("")` → no `<summary>` →
   `ValueError("pdf pipeline produced empty summary")` → the task fails and
   retries, each attempt wasting the full output budget.

### Symptom

- Ingest tasks fail with `ValueError(... produced empty summary)` at attempt
  3–5 **while the provider returns HTTP 200** — so it is NOT a 4xx
  auth/model error. If the provider rejected the request you'd see
  `BadRequestError` etc.; empty content means the call *succeeded* but
  produced no answer.
- `running-count` shows a backlog that never drains; the worker churns.

### Diagnosis probe

Call the endpoint through the app's own client and dump the raw response:

```python
resp = await get_chat_client("ingest").complete(req, retry=False)
msg = resp.raw_provider_response.choices[0].message
# reasoning_content non-empty + content is None + finish_reason='length'
#   ⇒ reasoning model is starving the output budget
```

### Fix

- Switch ingest/default to a **non-reasoning instruct model** that is *actually
  served* — verify with a probe, do not trust `/v1/models` (a listed model may
  410/500 on the upstream channel). On `ai.hybgzs.com`,
  `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` produced clean `<summary>` output
  (`finish='stop'`, no reasoning) where `step-3.5-flash`, `gpt-4o-mini`, and
  `qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct` were dead.
- Changing `llm_default_model` is live-safe: the Settings PUT handler calls
  `get_settings.cache_clear()` + `reset_clients_cache()`, so the running
  process picks it up without a restart.
- Already-`dead` tasks stay dead after the switch — re-ingest those files to
  backfill; new and retried ingests pick up the new model automatically.

## When to Create Flow Documentation

Create detailed flow docs when:

- Feature spans 3+ layers
- Multiple teams are involved
- Data format is complex
- Feature has caused bugs before

---

## Event Log / Projection Boundary

Append-only logs are cross-layer contracts. A single event travels through:

```
CLI input → event writer → events.jsonl → reader → filter → reducer → display
```

### Checklist: After Adding A New Event Kind Or Field

- [ ] Add the event kind to the central event taxonomy
- [ ] Add a typed event variant or type guard at the event layer
- [ ] Add normalization helpers for array/object fields that come from
      user input or JSON
- [ ] Keep `seq` / `id` assignment in the event writer only
- [ ] Make filters and reducers consume the typed event guard, not local casts
- [ ] Make display code consume reducer output or typed events, not raw JSON
- [ ] Add at least one regression that proves history replay and live filtering
      use the same filter model

**Real-world example**: Thread channels added `kind: "thread"`, `description`,
`context`, labels, and `lastSeq`. The first implementation replayed thread
state correctly, but several commands still re-parsed event payload fields with
local casts. The fix was to make the core event layer own `ThreadChannelEvent`
and `isThreadEvent`, make `reduceChannelMetadata` the only channel metadata
projection, and make `reduceThreads` the only thread replay reducer.
