"""End-to-end test for /v1/tend (user-triggered maintenance pass).

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python tests/test_tend_e2e.py

Verifies:
  1. POST /v1/tend enqueues all 6 kinds in TEND_CHAIN with priority + dedup
     reused if a periodic kind is already in flight.
  2. Each enqueued task has payload['tend_run_id'] = run_id.
  3. A `task_outcomes` dispatch row is written with task_kind=tend_dispatch
     and detail.dispatched listing every (kind, task_id, skipped) tuple.
  4. GET /v1/tend/{run_id} reports per-kind status + state counts.
  5. After tasks settle, all_settled flips to True.
  6. A second POST /v1/tend within the dedup window reuses pending rows
     and reports skipped=true for them.
