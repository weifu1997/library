"""End-to-end /discover + random walk + find_related agent tool.

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python tests/test_discover_e2e.py

Verifies:
  1. find_related random walk returns expected ranking. Heavily-connected
     direct neighbours score highest; 2-hop neighbours visible but lower;
     unconnected entries absent.
  2. Soft-deleted entries excluded from results even if their relations
     exist in the table.
  3. Empty seed (entry with no relations) returns [].
  4. find_related agent tool wraps the service correctly.
  5. Different source_kinds (mine_session_cooccurrence + mine_tag_overlap
     + mine_citation_graph) all contribute to walk weight — they share one
     observation_count column.
