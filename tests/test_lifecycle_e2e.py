"""End-to-end lifecycle (suggest_demotion + suggest_archival) sanity check.

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python tests/test_lifecycle_e2e.py

Verifies:
  Demotion (active → demoted):
    - active entry, no journal mention, created 30+ days ago → DEMOTED
    - active entry, recent journal mention                  → unchanged
    - active entry, no journal but only 5 days old           → unchanged (too fresh)
    - manual_active entry that meets every criterion         → unchanged (locked)

  Archival (demoted → archived):
    - demoted entry whose updated_at is 60+ days old, no journal mention
                                                              → ARCHIVED
    - demoted entry recently demoted (updated_at fresh)       → unchanged
    - demoted entry with recent journal mention               → unchanged
    - manual_archived entry                                   → unchanged
    - active entry (regardless of age)                        → unchanged

  Audit:
    - lifecycle_changed audit row for each successful transition

  task_outcomes:
    - one row per processed entry (file_entry, applied/deferred)
    - one summary row (global, applied or noop)
