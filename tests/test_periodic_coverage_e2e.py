"""Contract test: every "auto-maintenance" kind must be wired into the
periodic dispatcher.

This catches the class of bug where a new task handler is registered but the
author forgets to add it to `PERIODIC_INTERVALS` — meaning it would never run
unless the user manually triggered something. test_dispatcher_e2e verifies the
loop dispatches *what is in* PERIODIC_INTERVALS; this test verifies the *right
things are in it*.

If you intentionally make a kind manual-only (e.g., `/tend` chains it), remove
it from EXPECTED_PERIODIC and document why.

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python tests/test_periodic_coverage_e2e.py
