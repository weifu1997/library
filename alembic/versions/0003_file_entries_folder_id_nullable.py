"""file_entries.folder_id: drop NOT NULL on existing SQLite DBs

Revision ID: 0003_file_entries_folder_id_nullable
Revises: 0002_additive_columns
Create Date: 2026-05-27

Wraps `_relax_file_entries_folder_id_nullable`. SQLite-only: the helper
rebuilds the table when the live schema still has NOT NULL on
folder_id; on Postgres it's a no-op (operators drop the constraint via
a hand-written migration when needed).
