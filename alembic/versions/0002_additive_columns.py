"""additive columns: total_cache_read on conversations + sessions, sessions.deleted_at

Revision ID: 0002_additive_columns
Revises: 0001_initial
Create Date: 2026-05-27

Wraps `_apply_additive_columns` from `library.db.bootstrap`. The
helper is defensive: each ALTER runs only when the target column is
missing, so the revision is safe against DBs where bootstrap already
applied these mutations.
