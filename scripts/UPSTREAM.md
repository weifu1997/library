# scripts/ — upstream attribution

The Python sidecar packaging pipeline under `scripts/cpython/`,
`scripts/prepare-resources*`, and `scripts/ci/` was originally lifted
verbatim from [AstrBotDevs/AstrBot-desktop](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot-desktop)
(AGPL-3.0, the same license Library uses).

The first commit on `feat/python-sidecar` is the verbatim copy. Adaptations
to Library's pyproject layout, env-var names (`ASTRBOT_*` →
`LIBRARY_*`), and single-repo source layout follow in subsequent
commits, so the diff is the change set.

Files intentionally NOT copied:
- `scripts/prepare-resources/source-repo.mjs` — AstrBot uses a two-repo
  layout (desktop shell + backend in separate repos). Library is
  single-repo, so the source-fetch step is unnecessary.
- `*.test.mjs` — kept out for the initial spike. Worth porting once the
  pipeline stabilises.
- `desktop-bridge-*.mjs` and `bridge-bootstrap-updater-contract.*` —
  AstrBot-specific IPC bridge and Tauri updater contracts that don't
  apply here.
